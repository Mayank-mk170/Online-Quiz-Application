 Configure the Database
Edit your application.properties file:

## properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/quiz_app
spring.datasource.username=root
spring.datasource.password=yourpassword
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
spring.jpa.show-sql=true
jwt.secret=your_secret_key

## Build and Run the Application
mvn clean install
mvn spring-boot:run
The app runs by default on http://localhost:8080

## API Endpoints
## Authentication
Method	Endpoint	Description
POST	/api/user/signup	Register a new user
POST	/api/user/login	Authenticate user & generate JWT
POST	/api/user/admin	Create admin (restricted)

## Quiz Management (Admin)
Method	Endpoint	Description
POST	/api/quizzes	Create a quiz
PUT	/api/quizzes/{id}	Update quiz
DELETE	/api/quizzes/{id}	Delete quiz
GET	/api/quizzes	List all quizzes

## Quiz Attempts (User)
Method	Endpoint	Description
POST	/api/quiz/attempt/{quizId}	Attempt quiz
GET	/api/quiz/result/{userId}	View past results

## Security Implementation
Passwords are hashed using BCrypt before saving to the database.

JWT token is generated upon successful login.

Every API endpoint is protected via Spring Security.

Role-based access control ensures admins manage quizzes, while users can only attempt them.

## Documentation
## Setup Guide

Configure MySQL in application.properties.

Run the application using Maven or your IDE.

Test endpoints using Postman.

## User Guide
Signup using /api/user/signup

Login using /api/user/login

Use the returned JWT token in the Authorization header:

Authorization: Bearer <your_token_here>
Access secured endpoints accordingly.

## Assumptions & Limitations
JWT tokens expire after a fixed time (can be adjusted in JWTService).

No frontend implemented (backend-only project).

Currently supports one correct answer per question.

Pagination and filtering are not yet implemented.
